# Hangman C++

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.

NOTE: Words in this game can be changed by editing source code

## How to Play:

 - Enter any key to insert input
 - If you guess the word without killing Hangman, You Win
 - If you fail to do so, You Lose
